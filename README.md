My primary role in the group was to set up the server and inform the user flow throughout the app. From the time the users log into the page to when the user has "liked" or "disliked" the profiles, it's important for there to be a logical progression for where our App is taking them. Setting up the HTML and API Routes were important for this. 

In addition, I set up the connection from our database and the front end of our app. I ensured the data that the user inputted when logging into the app was easily accessible and stored for later use throughout the app.
